### Pokemon AI Battle
Pokemon random battle simulator against ChatGPT

## Description

This project is a Pokemon battle simulation system that allows players to battle using random (WIP) Pokemon against an AI. It consists of a backend for handling game logic and a frontend to display the battle interface, tied together by MVC architecture. Players can choose moves, switch Pokemon, and interact with an AI that attempts to react to their moves.

# Background

This is a personal project that served as a challenge to create a full-stack project on something I love, Pokemon. Along the way, I was also forced to use frameworks and libraries I had never worked with before, like React and Spring Boot. Particularly, working with both a frontend and a backend and trying to get them to work together was great experience. 

## Technologies
# Backend
Java
Spring Boot (Spring AI): Integrated with OpenAI API
Spring SSE (Server Sent Events): Forward battle events to frontend
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Built into AI system to simulate battle decisions based on accurate information on Pokemon battle mechanics, moves, etc.

# Frontend
React JS

# Other
REST API: For managing frontend-backend interaction.

## Setup
Work in progress
